 * The parameter of this function differs from the TypeScript definition
 * The reason for this is that the typesscript definition is what is being
 * exposed to other developers when they use this function. What they don't
 * see is that their implementation is being changed at build time and instead
 * of the script that they import, the (compiled) sources of their script are
 * being passed to this function. So the actual implementation differs a bit
 * from what developers get to see of it.
 *
 * The parameter this function receives is a promise resolving to the compiled
 * source-code of the script developers intend to import. It is not a function
 * that returns a promise, but the promise itself, so that is why there is this
 * weird line that just awaits a variable name
 *
 * @param {Promise<string>} sourceCodeAsPromised
 * @returns {import('react').VFC}

   * suspence, that react component cannot be rendered. Currently, this is
   * an issue especially with SSR.
   *
   * Luckily, even without suspence, next js provides `next/dynamic` which
