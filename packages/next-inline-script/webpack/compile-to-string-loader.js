/**
 * This loader will compile and bundle the file it has been called on

 * bundle's source code as a string
 *
 * Webpack is badly documented and a lot of thing you will have to
 * search for for a while so here are some useful links:
 *
 *  - how to set the library target of the child compiler
 *    https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11909
 *
 * Known Caveats and todos:
 *
 *  - The code is being compiled via a child compiler, which uses the
 *    config it gets from the compilation process it is called from.
 *    The parent compilation may not fit our needs of creating opti-
 *    mized client-side code. Next for instance compiles things on the
 *    server so we need to watch out of this and override configs that
 *    do not fit our needs here
 *
 *  - The compiled output will not be minified, and it is very hard
 *    to get the parent compiler's TerserPlugin working
 *
 *  - the compiled code exports some esModule definitions that we don't
 *    need
 *
 * @type {import('webpack').LoaderDefinitionFunction}
